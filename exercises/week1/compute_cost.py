def computeCost(X, y, theta):
    """
    Compute cost for linear regression. Computes the cost of using theta as the
    parameter for linear regression to fit the data points in X and y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like
        The input dataset of shape (m x n+1), where m is the number of examples,
        and n is the number of features. We assume a vector of one's already
        appended to the features so we have n+1 columns.

    y : array_like
        The values of the function at each data point. This is a vector of
        shape (m, ).

    theta : array_like
        The parameters for the regression function. This is a vector of
        shape (n+1, ).

    Returns
    -------
    J : float
        The value of the regression cost function.

    Instructions
    ------------
    Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
    You should set J to the cost.
